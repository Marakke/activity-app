# Project Rules

## Framework & Libraries
- Use **Next.js 15** with App Router
- Use **React 19** features and patterns
- Use **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- Use **TypeScript** with strict mode

## Code Style & Formatting
- Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configuration

## Next.js 15 Best Practices
- Use Server Components by default
- Use Client Components only when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
- Use `'use client'` directive at the top of Client Components
- Leverage React 19 features like Server Actions, Server Components, and improved Suspense
- Use async/await in Server Components for data fetching
- Prefer `fetch` with Next.js caching strategies

## React 19 Best Practices
- Use React 19 hooks and patterns
- Prefer function components
- Use proper TypeScript types for props
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

## Tailwind CSS
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Prefer Tailwind classes over custom CSS when possible
- Use Tailwind's responsive breakpoints
- Follow Tailwind's design system conventions
- Add `pointer-cusor` to hoverable buttons

## File Organization
- Use the `@/` alias for imports from the `src/` directory
- Follow the existing project structure
- Place components in `src/components/`
- Place utilities in `src/lib/`

## Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic, BUT do not use comments for 'obvious' code snippets
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Ensure type safety
